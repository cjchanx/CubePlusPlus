# Introduction
Cube++ simplifies the process of creating a C/C++ codebase for an STM32 microcontroller in STM32CubeIDE while fully supporting CubeIDE's native code generation. This project is intended to be a submodule in a CubeIDE project to give access to some useful C++ wrappers and a method of routing control from the C main.c file to the C++ codebase located in one dedicated folder to support cleaner code compared to mixing it with code generation, and preventing the need for constantly renaming `main.c` to `main.cpp` every time code generation happens. Please refer to the [Setup Instructions](#Setup-Instructions) below for a guide on how to setup the project with Cube++

Cube++ is based on the core code of the [Student Organization for Aerospace Research's Avionics Software](https://github.com/StudentOrganisationForAerospaceResearch/AvionicsSoftware/tree/d3b55eb04511bf8b2d5ea3fb2d51fbd1329d9e81). As the codebase was originally intended for use in a specific way there are still updates to be made to improve compatability and capabilities.

# Setup Instructions 
1. [CubeIDE Project Setup](#CubeIDE-Project-Setup)
2. [IOC Setup](#IOC-Setup)
3. [Cube++ Submodule Setup](#Cube-Setup)
4. [Codebase Setup](#Codebase-Setup)

## CubeIDE Project Setup
- Create a new project for your specific chip and select C++ when it asks you for Language

## IOC Setup
Open the `.ioc` file by double clicking on it inside the project

### Middleware Setup

- Under `Middleware and Software Packs` enable FreeRTOS using `CMSIS_V1` (unless you are using a multi-core CPU in which case `CMSIS_V2` may be preferred)
- Change the following values in **config parameters**
    - FreeRTOS Heap Size to fairly large (eg. 64KB on a 90KB RAM chip)
    - MINIMAL_STACK_SIZE to at least 192 Words
    - Under Software Timer Defines "USE_TIMERS" should be enabled

- Under `Middleware and Software Packs` > FreeRTOS > Advanced Settings
    - Enable USE_NEWLIB_REENTRANT

- Under Computing > CRC 
    - Enable Activated

- Under `System Core` > SYS > Timebase Source
    - Change the timebase source to a timer instead of SysTick (CubeIDE will recommend you do this upon code generation)

### IOC Peripheral Setup
#### For UART Debug Line 
**(if not defining `DEBUG_DISABLED` as mentioned in the [Codebase Setup](#Codebase-Setup) section below)**

- Inside Pinout and Configuration > Connectivity
    - Select a UART/USART line for debug (if you choose to enable it) and set to Asynchronous mode with hardware flow control off

- At the top select Project Manager tab, go to the Advanced Settings and select the UART line for debug under Driver Selector
    - Change this UART line driver from `HAL` to `LL`

## Cube++ Setup
Add the Cube++ repository into the root folder as a submodule using one of these commands

SSH
```
git submodule add git@github.com:cjchanx/CubePlusPlus.git Cube++
```
HTTPS
```
git submodule add https://github.com/cjchanx/cubeplusplus-examples.git Cube++
```

Please add the following to include paths:
(right click on the folder and select `Add/Remove Include Path...`)
- Cube++/Core
- Cube++/Drivers/Inc
- Cube++/Libraries/embedded-template-library/include

Please ensure the following folders are not in the exclude from build option:
(right click on the folder, select properties, select configuration 'all configuration' and untick "select `Exclude Resource from Build`")
- (none for this version)

### Codebase Setup
An example project utilizing Cube++ with basic CUBE_PRINT support, in addition to a Debug receive task for parsing input data on the debug line can be found at https://github.com/cjchanx/cubeplusplus-examples/tree/main/Basic_Debug

- It is recommended to setup a new folder called `Components` or `Modules` in the root where all the code goes.
- There are a few files that you should have in `Components`/`Modules`:
	- SystemDefines.hpp : An example can be found [here](https://github.com/cjchanx/cubeplusplus-examples/blob/main/Basic_Debug/Components/SystemDefines.hpp)
	- main_system.cpp   : This can be named anything you want, but should contain the run_main() function that is the entry point for your codebase, example [here](https://github.com/cjchanx/cubeplusplus-examples/blob/main/Basic_Debug/Components/main_system.cpp)
	- main_system.hpp   : Header file for main_system.cpp, example [here](https://github.com/cjchanx/cubeplusplus-examples/blob/main/Basic_Debug/Components/main_system.hpp)
	- SysCore/Inc/RunInterface.hpp : Header file for the run interface which allows C code to call into the C++ codebase without errors, example [here](https://github.com/cjchanx/cubeplusplus-examples/blob/main/Basic_Debug/Components/Core/Inc/RunInterface.hpp)
	- SysCore/RunInterface.cpp : Code file for the run interface, example [here](https://github.com/cjchanx/cubeplusplus-examples/blob/main/Basic_Debug/Components/Core/RunInterface.cpp)
- Setup Debug UART
	- Setup one UART line as the UART debug line by following theinstructions uder Cube++/Drivers/UARTDriver_README.md, this should correspond to UART Driver linked to the 
	`constexpr UARTDriver* const DEFAULT_DEBUG_UART_DRIVER = UART::Debug;` line that is required to be in the SystemDefines.hpp file
	- In the case that you do not want a UART line dedicated to debug, then set DEFAULT_DEBUG_UART_DRIVER to nullptr, and
	define the macro DISABLE_DEBUG using `#define DISABLE_DEBUG` inside SystemDefines.hpp
- Setup main.c
	- Under Private includes in the first USER CODE BEGIN section, add the run interface as an include `RunInterface.hpp`
	- Inside the int main(void) function definition, add the following inside `USER CODE BEGIN 2`:
```
  run_interface();
  #if 0
```
	- Then inside `USER CODE BEGIN 3` after the `}` you want to put an `#endif`
	- This ensures that the only tasks that will be started up are the ones you add to your run_main() function
 

# Solving Issues
## Components/Cube++ excluded from build
- CubeIDE may exclude newly added folders from the build, to include it right click on the folder, go into Properties > C/C++ Build (on the left bar) > Select Configuration: `[All Configurations]` in the dropdown box, and then untick "Exclude Resource from Build"
